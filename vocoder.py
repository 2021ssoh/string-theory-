# 1. Write a function called shout that takes in a string as an argument and returns it in all caps.
# def shout(string):
#     output = string.upper()
#     print(output)
#     return(output)

# a = shout("sleep")
# print(a)

# 2. Write a function called whisper that takes in a string as an argument and returns it in all lowercase.
# def whisper(string):
#     output = string.lower()
#     print(output)
#     return(output)

# a = whisper("SLEEP")            to make the function run
# print(a)

# 3. Write a function called how_many_letters that takes in a string as an argument and returns the number of letters in that string.
# def how_many_letters(string):
#     print(len(string))
#     return(string)

# how_many_letters("number of letters")


# 4. Write a function called work_it that takes in a string as an argument and returns it backwards and with the first letter capitalized.
#    For example, work_it("I put my thing down flip it and reverse it") would return "Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gniht ym tup i"
# def work_it(string):
#     output = string[::-1].capitalize()
#     return output

# a = work_it("I need help")
# print(a)

# 5. Write a function called repeat_it that takes in a word and a number, and returns the word that many times.
#    For example, repeat_it("Banana", 3) would return "BananaBananaBanana"
# def repeat_it(string):
#     output = string.rstrip(",3")
#     return output

# a = repeat_it("apple,3")
# print(a*3)


# txt = "banana, 3"

# x = txt.rstrip(", 3")
# y = txt.lstrip("banana,")
# print(x*3)
# print(y)

# 6. Write a function called will_it_nametag that takes in a name and a number, and tells you whether the name can be printed on a nametag that size.
#    For example, will_it_nametag("Peter", 10) will return True, but will_it_nametag("Peter", 4) will return False, because "Peter" is 5 letters long, and needs at least 5 spaces to fit on a nametag.
# def will_it_nametag(string,number):
#     length = len(string)
#     if length<=number:
#         return True
#     else:
#         return False

# print(will_it_nametag("Peter,6"))


# 7. Write a function called add_liar that takes in two numbers and prints out a lie like "Sorry, I don't know how to add ___ and ___."
#    BUT even though it *prints* that it doesn't know the answer, have the function return the correct answer anyways.
# def add_liar(num1, num2):
#     print("Sorry")
#     return num1 + num2

# a = add_liar(2,1)
# print(a)


# 8. CHALLENGE: Now that you've written all these functions, try combining them. what would happen if you tried to call repeat_it(work_it("Stressed"), 3) ?
# I dont't know how to answer this question




# 9. MEGA CHALLENGE: Write a function called doubler that takes in a string and returns it with every letter doubled.
#    For example, doubler("Lost in the Woods") would return "LLoosstt iinn tthhee WWooooddss"
